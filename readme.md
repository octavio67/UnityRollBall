***NOTES***

The scenes have a box collider on each wall to prevent the ball from going out of the plane.


The points counter is negative to indicate the pickups that remain to be collected.


The scene change from 1 to 2 is done by checking if the ball collides with a box collider placed at the scene exit and all pickups have been collected.


The game ends in scene 2 checking that all the pickups have been collected.


For the ball to jump, a plane is placed on top of each box that simulates a step with its corresponding label to check whether or not the ball is touching the plane to prevent it from jumping more than once when it is in the air.
